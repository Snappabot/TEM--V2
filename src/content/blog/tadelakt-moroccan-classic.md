## The Ancient Art of Tadelakt

For centuries, Moroccan artisans have perfected a unique lime plaster technique called **Tadelakt** (from the Arabic *دلك*, meaning "to rub"). This traditional finish, originally used in hammams and riads, creates a seamless, waterproof surface with an unmistakable organic warmth.

### Why Tadelakt?

In a world of mass-produced tiles and synthetic coatings, Tadelakt stands apart. It's:

- **Completely waterproof** — ideal for showers, baths, and wet areas
- **Naturally antibacterial** — lime's high pH inhibits mould and mildew
- **Seamless** — no grout lines, no corners for grime to collect
- **Breathable** — allows moisture to pass through, preventing trapped dampness
- **Uniquely beautiful** — every surface is one-of-a-kind

### The Traditional Process

Authentic Tadelakt isn't just a product — it's a process. Here's how we create this remarkable finish:

#### 1. The Lime
We use specially sourced lime putty, aged for maximum workability. The quality of the lime determines everything.

#### 2. Application
Multiple thin layers are applied by hand, each one compressed and smoothed. This builds density and strength.

#### 3. Polishing
The magic happens here. Using smooth river stones, we burnish the surface for hours. This compression creates the waterproof membrane.

#### 4. Soap Treatment
Traditional black olive oil soap is applied and worked into the surface. The fatty acids react with the lime, creating a natural water-repellent finish that deepens with age.

### Where to Use Tadelakt

**Bathrooms**  
Tadelakt truly shines in wet areas. Imagine a shower enclosure with no tiles, no grout — just smooth, continuous surface that repels water naturally.

**Kitchens**  
Splashbacks and benchtops gain character and durability. The surface is heat-resistant and easy to maintain.

**Feature Walls**  
Even in dry areas, Tadelakt's tactile beauty makes a stunning statement.

**Pools & Spas**  
For those seeking the ultimate luxury, Tadelakt-lined pools offer an experience unlike any other.

### Colours & Textures

Natural mineral pigments allow for an earthy palette:

- Warm terracottas and ochres
- Soft creams and whites
- Cool greys and charcoals
- Deep, dramatic blacks

The finish can be adjusted from a soft matte to a polished sheen, depending on the desired effect.

### Maintenance & Longevity

Tadelakt is surprisingly low-maintenance:

- Wipe clean with a damp cloth
- Occasional soap treatment refreshes the surface
- Avoid harsh chemical cleaners
- Minor marks can be buffed out

With proper care, Tadelakt surfaces can last for generations — improving with age as the patina develops.

### Bring Morocco to Melbourne
