## Master the Art of Marbellino

We're thrilled to announce our upcoming **Marbellino Melbourne Workshop** — a hands-on training experience designed for plasterers, builders, architects, and passionate DIYers who want to master this stunning Venetian-style finish.

### What is Marbellino?

Marbellino is a refined polished plaster that delivers the luminous depth of traditional Venetian stucco with modern durability. Its silky, marble-like finish transforms any wall into a statement piece, reflecting light in ways that paint simply cannot achieve.

### Workshop Details

**Date:** February 2026 (specific dates TBA)  
**Location:** Melbourne, Victoria  
**Duration:** 2-day intensive  
**Skill Level:** All levels welcome

### What You'll Learn

Over two intensive days, participants will gain practical experience in:

- **Surface preparation** — Understanding substrates and primers essential for long-lasting results
- **Base coat application** — Building the foundation for a flawless finish
- **Colour mixing** — Creating custom tones using natural pigments
- **Polishing techniques** — The art of burnishing to achieve that signature lustrous sheen
- **Sealing and protection** — Ensuring your finish stands the test of time
