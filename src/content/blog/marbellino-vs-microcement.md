## The Finish Showdown

We often get asked: *"What's the difference between Marbellino and microcement?"* Both are popular choices for seamless, contemporary surfaces — but they deliver very different results. Let's break it down.

### At a Glance

| Aspect | Marbellino | Microcement |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Composition** | Lime-based, natural minerals | Cement-based, polymers |
| **Finish** | Polished, luminous depth | Matte to satin, uniform |
| **Thickness** | 1-2mm | 2-3mm |
| **Best For** | Walls, feature surfaces | Floors, wet areas, high-traffic |
| **Character** | Organic variation, movement | Industrial, consistent |
| **Feel** | Warm, tactile | Cool, smooth |

### What is Marbellino?

Marbellino is a **refined Venetian-style plaster** made from aged lime putty and fine marble dust. It belongs to the family of traditional Italian stuccos — techniques refined over centuries.

**The Look:**  
Marbellino delivers depth. Multiple translucent layers create an almost three-dimensional quality, with subtle variations in tone and sheen that catch light differently throughout the day. It's unmistakably luxurious.

**The Feel:**  
Warm to the touch, with a silky surface that invites you to run your hand across it. The polished finish has a gentle lustre, never cold or industrial.

**Best Applications:**
- Feature walls and statement surfaces
- Living rooms, bedrooms, lobbies
- Surfaces where visual depth matters
- Projects seeking timeless elegance

### What is Microcement?

Microcement is a **cement-based coating** reinforced with polymers and fibres. It emerged from industrial flooring technology, adapted for decorative use.

**The Look:**  
Microcement offers a more uniform, contemporary aesthetic. While it can have subtle texture, it tends toward consistency — an even tone across the surface. The look is modern and understated.

**The Feel:**  
Cooler to the touch than lime-based plasters. The surface is smooth and durable, designed to withstand foot traffic and daily wear.

**Best Applications:**
- Floors (residential and commercial)
- Bathrooms and wet areas (with proper sealing)
- Kitchens, benchtops, splashbacks
- High-traffic commercial spaces
- Overlay on existing tiles

### The Key Differences

#### 1. Material Philosophy

**Marbellino** is rooted in tradition. It's fundamentally a lime plaster — a material that's been used for thousands of years. The process is artisanal, the result is organic.

**Microcement** is engineered. It's designed for performance in demanding environments. The result is controlled and predictable.

#### 2. Visual Character

**Marbellino's** beauty lies in its imperfection. The interplay of layers creates movement — shadows and highlights that shift with the light. No two walls are identical.

**Microcement's** appeal is its uniformity. For contemporary minimalist design, that consistency is often exactly what's wanted.

#### 3. Durability & Use

**Marbellino** is durable for walls but not designed for floors or heavy wear. It's a decorative finish, not a work surface.

**Microcement** is built for abuse. Properly sealed, it handles foot traffic, spills, and the demands of daily life. It's functional design.

#### 4. Maintenance

Both require care, but differently:

- **Marbellino:** Dust lightly, avoid abrasive cleaners, can be re-polished if scuffed
- **Microcement:** Clean normally, may need resealing every few years in wet areas

### Which Should You Choose?

**Choose Marbellino if you want:**
- A feature surface with depth and soul
- Warmth and tactile beauty
- Connection to traditional craftsmanship
- A wall that becomes art

**Choose Microcement if you need:**
- A seamless floor alternative to tiles
- Durability in wet or high-traffic areas
- A consistent, industrial-modern aesthetic
- A practical surface that performs

### Can You Use Both?

Absolutely. We often see projects that use Marbellino on feature walls and microcement on floors — the contrast can be stunning. The warmth of polished plaster above, the utility of microcement below.

### Our Recommendation

Don't choose based on trend. Choose based on how you'll use the space and what you want to feel when you're in it.

Marbellino creates atmosphere. Microcement creates function.

Both are excellent materials. The right choice depends on your project's soul.
