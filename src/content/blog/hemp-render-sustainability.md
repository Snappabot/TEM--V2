## Building Naturally, Building Safely

There's a misconception that natural building materials can't meet modern safety standards. Our **Earthen Hemp Rammed Render** proves otherwise — achieving rigorous fire safety certification while offering environmental benefits that synthetic alternatives simply cannot match.

### Fire Safety Certification

After extensive testing, we're proud to announce that our Earthen Hemp Rammed Render has achieved **fire certification** compliant with Australian building standards. This means:

- **Approved for use** in residential and commercial applications
- **Meets BCA requirements** for wall systems
- **Documented fire resistance** for peace of mind

This certification opens doors for architects and builders who want to specify sustainable materials without compromising on safety compliance.

### What Makes Hemp Render Different?

Unlike conventional renders that rely on cement and synthetic additives, our hemp render combines:

**Hemp Shiv**  
The woody core of the hemp plant, processed into lightweight aggregate. Hemp is:
- A fast-growing, renewable crop
- Carbon-negative (absorbs more CO2 than it releases)
- Naturally resistant to pests and mould

**Natural Lime Binder**  
Lime has been used in construction for millennia. It:
- Absorbs CO2 as it cures
- Remains breathable throughout its lifespan
- Can be recycled at end of life

**Earth & Natural Pigments**  
Local clays and mineral pigments provide colour and character without synthetic dyes.

### Environmental Impact

The numbers tell a compelling story:

| Factor | Cement Render | Hemp Render |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Carbon Footprint | High (cement production) | Negative (carbon sequestering) |
| Embodied Energy | High | Low |
| End of Life | Landfill | Compostable/recyclable |
| Indoor Air Quality | Can off-gas | Zero VOCs |
| Thermal Mass | Moderate | Excellent |

### Performance Benefits

Sustainability doesn't mean sacrifice. Hemp render delivers practical advantages:

**Thermal Regulation**  
The combination of hemp's insulating properties and lime's thermal mass creates walls that buffer temperature extremes naturally — reducing heating and cooling costs.

**Moisture Management**  
Breathable walls prevent the moisture trapping that causes mould in sealed modern buildings. The wall "breathes," maintaining healthy indoor humidity levels.

**Acoustic Performance**  
The fibrous structure provides excellent sound absorption, creating quieter, more comfortable spaces.

**Durability**  
Lime renders gain strength over time as they continue to carbonate. Properly maintained, they can last centuries.

### The Rammed Earth Aesthetic

Our rammed technique creates a distinctive layered appearance that celebrates the natural materials:

- Visible strata reveal the building process
- Subtle colour variations from natural pigments
- A tactile surface that invites touch
- Connection to ancient building traditions

### Applications

Earthen Hemp Rammed Render suits:

- **Residential feature walls** — internal or external
- **Commercial interiors** — offices, retail, hospitality
- **Sustainable developments** — meeting green building targets
- **Heritage-sympathetic projects** — compatible with traditional construction

### Working With Us

We offer:

- **Material supply** — hemp render premix ready for application
- **Technical support** — specifications and application guidance
- **Training** — workshops for professionals wanting to learn the technique
