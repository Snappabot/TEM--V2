## Navigating the World of Artisan Plasters

The renaissance of decorative plasters has given architects and homeowners extraordinary options — but with choice comes complexity. This guide walks you through the decision-making process, helping you match the right finish to your project's needs.

### Step 1: Define Your Space

Before exploring materials, understand your canvas:

**Room Function**
- Is this a wet area (bathroom, kitchen)?
- High traffic or low traffic?
- Residential or commercial?
- Interior or exterior?

**Lighting Conditions**
- Natural light direction and intensity
- Artificial lighting scheme
- How will the surface be viewed throughout the day?

**Existing Materials**
- What are you coordinating with? (timber, stone, metal)
- Is this a feature or a backdrop?
- What's the overall design language?

### Step 2: Understand Your Options

Here's a breakdown of our core finishes and their ideal applications:

#### Marbellino (Venetian-Style Polished Plaster)

**Character:** Luminous depth, marble-like sheen, organic variation  
**Best For:** Feature walls, living areas, bedrooms, lobbies  
**Avoid:** Floors, wet areas, external use  
**Maintenance:** Low — dust and occasional polish  

*Choose Marbellino when you want a wall to become art.*

#### Tadelakt (Moroccan Waterproof Plaster)

**Character:** Smooth, seamless, waterproof, organic warmth  
**Best For:** Bathrooms, showers, hammams, pools, sinks  
**Avoid:** High-impact areas, floors with heavy furniture  
**Maintenance:** Moderate — occasional soap treatment  

*Choose Tadelakt for wet areas where you refuse to compromise on beauty.*

#### Tadelino (Contemporary Polished Lime)

**Character:** Refined, subtle variation, versatile  
**Best For:** Whole-room applications, contemporary interiors, commercial  
**Avoid:** Direct water immersion  
**Maintenance:** Low  

*Choose Tadelino for elegant restraint across larger surface areas.*

#### Rokka (Textured Earth Finish)

**Character:** Bold texture, raw, brutalist  
**Best For:** Feature walls, commercial spaces, statements  
**Avoid:** Surfaces requiring easy cleaning  
**Maintenance:** Very low  

*Choose Rokka when you want drama and tactile presence.*

#### Concretum (Industrial Refined)

**Character:** Concrete-inspired, urban, contemporary  
**Best For:** Modern interiors, commercial, minimalist design  
**Avoid:** Traditional or heritage contexts  
**Maintenance:** Low  

*Choose Concretum for controlled industrial aesthetic.*

#### Earthen Renders (Hemp & Natural)

**Character:** Layered, textural, sustainable  
**Best For:** Eco-projects, feature walls, natural homes  
**Avoid:** High-moisture areas (unless specified)  
**Maintenance:** Low  

*Choose Earthen Renders when sustainability is non-negotiable.*

### Step 3: Consider Practical Factors

#### Durability Requirements

| Finish | Impact Resistance | Moisture Resistance | UV Stability |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Marbellino | Moderate | Low | Good |
| Tadelakt | Moderate | Excellent | Good |
| Tadelino | Moderate | Moderate | Good |
| Rokka | Good | Moderate | Excellent |
| Concretum | Good | Moderate | Good |
| Earthen | Moderate | Variable | Good |

#### Substrate Compatibility

Not all finishes work on all substrates. Key considerations:

- **Plasterboard:** Most finishes suitable with proper preparation
- **Brick/Masonry:** Excellent for most renders and plasters
- **Existing Tiles:** Requires specialist preparation
- **Timber:** Generally not recommended (movement issues)
- **External Walls:** Requires breathable, weather-resistant options

### Step 4: Get the Colour Right

Artisan plasters aren't paint — colour behaves differently:

**Depth Not Flatness**  
Plaster colours have dimension. The same pigment will look different at different times of day as light plays through the layers.

**Sample Before Committing**  
Always view samples in situ, in your actual lighting conditions. A sample in our studio will look different in your north-facing living room.

**Consider Undertones**  
Natural mineral pigments have warmth that synthetic colours lack. Greys might lean warm or cool. Whites can be creamy or crisp.

**Start Neutral, Accent Bold**  
If in doubt, neutral bases with colour accents offer flexibility.

### Step 5: Specify Correctly

For architects and designers, proper specification ensures proper results:

**Include:**
- Finish name and colour reference
- Substrate condition requirements
- Primer/preparation specification
- Number of coats
- Final finish level (matte/satin/polished)
- Sealer requirements
- Maintenance recommendations

**Coordinate With:**
- Waterproofing trades (especially in wet areas)
- Electrician (for recessed lighting decisions)
- Joiner (for junction details)

### Step 6: Budget Realistically

Artisan plasters are an investment. Unlike paint, you're paying for:

- Premium natural materials
- Skilled labour (these finishes take time)
- Multiple coats and curing periods
- Finishing and polishing processes

**Rough Guide (per m²):**
- Basic textured finish: $$
- Polished plaster: $$$
- Tadelakt (wet areas): $$$$

The value lies in longevity and uniqueness. A Marbellino wall will still be beautiful in 50 years; a painted wall will need refreshing in 5-10.

### Quick Decision Matrix

| Your Priority | Recommended Finish |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Luxury feel | Marbellino |
| Waterproof beauty | Tadelakt |
| Sustainable build | Earthen Renders |
| Bold statement | Rokka |
| Modern minimalism | Concretum |
| Versatile elegance | Tadelino |
